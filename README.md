# 🏡 **Real Estate Price Analysis & Prediction ML Project** 🏠

Welcome to my **Real Estate Price Analysis & Prediction** project! Today, I built this exciting **Machine Learning** project using **Python** and its powerful libraries. In this project, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, engineered useful features, and built a machine learning model to predict real estate prices. 🚀

## 🔍 **What’s Inside?**

- **🔑 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
  Dive deep into the dataset, uncover patterns, and explore how various features affect real estate prices. 🧐

- **🧰 Feature Engineering**  
  Extract meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance and predictive accuracy. 🔧

- **💻 Machine Learning Model**  
  Developed and trained a machine learning model to predict real estate prices based on key features. 📊

## 🌟 **Key Highlights**

- **📊 Data Preprocessing:**  
  Cleaned and prepared data by handling missing values, outliers, and scaling features. 🧹

- **🔄 Feature Selection & Transformation:**  
  Utilized statistical techniques to select the most impactful features. 🧠

- **📈 Data Visualization:**  
  Created various visualizations like scatter plots, bar graphs, and heatmaps to help understand the trends. 🎨

- **🧑‍💻 Model Evaluation:**  
  Applied different machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to predict prices. ⚙️

- **⚡ Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  Optimized models using Grid Search to improve prediction accuracy. ⚙️

  The language that makes it all come together. 💻

- **📚 Libraries:**  
  - **Pandas** for data manipulation 🧑‍💻
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization 📊
  - **Scikit-learn** for model building and evaluation 🤖

- **🧠 ML Algorithms:**  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  
  - Random Forest Regressor

## 🎯 **Goal of the Project**

To create an accurate model that can predict real estate prices based on key features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, and more. 🏡💰

## 👨‍💻 **How to Run the Project:**

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
3. Run the `main.py` script to perform EDA, feature engineering, and model training.

   Here’s a concise yet detailed 50-line section for your GitHub README on **How to Run the Project**:

## 🛠️ **How to Run the Project** 🔧

Follow these steps to get started with the **Real Estate Price Analysis & Prediction ML Project**:

### 1. **Clone the Repository** 🚀

First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-price-prediction.git
```

### 2. **Navigate to Project Directory** 🧭

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd real-estate-price-prediction
```

### 3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** 🌍

(Optional, but recommended) Set up a **virtual environment** to manage dependencies:

- For **Windows**:
  
  ```bash
  python -m venv env
  env\Scripts\activate
  ```

- For **Mac/Linux**:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv env
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. **Install Dependencies** 📦

Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all necessary libraries, including Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and more. 📚

### 5. **Run the Script** 🖥️

To perform the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Feature Engineering**, and **Model Building**, run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute the entire process of:

- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Cleaning and preparing the data
- Engineering features
- Training the machine learning models
- Evaluating model performance

### 6. **View Results** 📈

Once the script finishes, you’ll see the results printed in the terminal, including:

- **Visualizations**: Graphs and plots showing insights from the data (generated via Matplotlib and Seaborn).
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **R²**.
  
### 7. **Optional: Modify Parameters** ⚙️

Feel free to tweak model parameters or add new features in the `config.py` file to further improve predictions!

### 8. **Explore the Data** 🧐

You can explore the dataset and visualizations by running the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook EDA_notebook.ipynb
```

This will give you an interactive environment for deeper analysis.

### 💡 **Troubleshooting Tips** 🛠️

- Ensure you have the correct Python version installed (Python 3.x).
- If you encounter errors during installation, try upgrading `pip`:
  
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
